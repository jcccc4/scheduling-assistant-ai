# Intelligent Scheduling System Documentation

## Overview
The intelligent scheduling system automatically schedules tasks based on user preferences, task priorities, and available time slots. The system learns from user behavior and adapts scheduling patterns accordingly.

## Core Components

### 1. Services

#### SchedulingService
- Main orchestrator for the scheduling system
- Coordinates between optimization, preferences, and time slot services
- Provides a simplified interface for the UI layer

#### TimeSlotService
- Manages time slot availability
- Handles conflict detection between tasks
- Generates available time slots within working hours

#### PreferenceService
- Manages user preferences
- Learns from user behavior
- Stores and retrieves scheduling preferences
- Adapts to user's preferred working patterns

#### TaskOptimizationService
- Optimizes task scheduling based on multiple factors
- Uses ScoringRules to evaluate potential time slots
- Selects the best time slot based on composite scores

### 2. Scoring System

The scoring system uses multiple factors to determine the optimal time slot:

1. **Time Preference Score**
   - Morning: before 12 PM
   - Afternoon: 12 PM - 5 PM
   - Evening: after 5 PM
   - Higher score for user's preferred time of day

2. **Priority Score**
   - High priority tasks: 1.5x multiplier
   - Medium priority tasks: 1.2x multiplier
   - Low priority tasks: standard scoring

3. **Earliness Score**
   - Slight preference for earlier slots
   - Helps prevent task accumulation

4. **Break Time Score**
   - Ensures adequate breaks between tasks
   - Based on user's minimum break time preference

### 3. UI Components

#### TaskFormFields
- Provides auto-scheduling toggle
- Updates automatically when auto-schedule is enabled
- Shows loading state during scheduling

#### TimePreferencesForm
- Allows users to set scheduling preferences
- Includes:
  - Preferred time of day
  - Minimum break between tasks
  - Maximum tasks per day

## Learning Mechanism

The system learns from:
1. User's manual scheduling patterns
2. Task completion times
3. Preferred working hours
4. Break patterns

## Usage

### Auto-Scheduling a Task
```typescript
const { scheduleTask } = useScheduling();

// Schedule a task
const optimalTime = await scheduleTask({
  title: "Meeting",
  duration: 60,
  priority: "high"
});
```

### Updating Preferences
```typescript
const { updateUserPreference } = useScheduling();

// Update user preference
updateUserPreference('preferredTimeOfDay', 'morning');
```

## Future Improvements

1. Advanced Learning
   - Machine learning integration
   - Pattern recognition
   - Workload optimization

2. Calendar Integration
   - External calendar sync
   - Multiple calendar support
   - Timezone handling

3. Team Scheduling
   - Multi-user scheduling
   - Team availability
   - Meeting optimization
